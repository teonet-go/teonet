Teonet is designed to create client-server systems and build networks for server applications operating within a microservice architecture. To do this, Teonet creates a network / cloud transport between its members. This transport uses UDP for communication between network peers. UDP packets are encrypted with unique keys. Teonet uses its own UDP-based protocol called Teonet Reliable UDP (TRU) for real-time communication, which allows low latency messages to be sent and protocol reliability features.
